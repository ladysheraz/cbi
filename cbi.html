        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2><i>CBi Innovations Ltd.</i></h2>
        <p>CBiIL started business formally April 1, 2020 (though incorporated<br>
            since September 2017 and has carried out some pre-commencement<br>
            activities since September 2019 such as purchasing systems and<br>
            implementing software on them). The year end of March 31st was<br>
            chosen to be in concert with the onset of rains in Nigeria as most<br>
            agriculture is still rain-fed. The
            company has an authorised share<br>
            capital of N200million of which 77.5% is fully paid-up.<br>

        <h2><i>From a Bussiness Case</i></h2>
        <p>The overall problem we are trying to address is one of building a self<br>
            -sustaining private extension/field service organisation that leverages<br>
            modern technology (both hardware and software) for data aggregation.<br>
            This data aggregation enables effective and efficient aggregation of<br>
            smallholder producers (young men &
            women) in ways that give<br>
            predictability and traceability to volumes and quality of production,<br>
            without
            adding too significantly to the unit economics of production,<br>
            whilst being modular and scalable.</p>

        <h2><i>The Average Farmer</i></h2>
        <p>Looking at what we do at CBi, we are trying to simplify<br>
            <i><b>Farming,</b></i> using Technology to solve if not all <br>
            but the most important aspect of <i><b>Farming,</b></i>
        </p>
        <p>That been said, we are not looking at just the <i><b>URBAN</b></i> location<br>
            of Agriculture but also the <i><b>RURAL</b></i> location of an Average Farmer.</p><br>
